# ChatBot-Jarvis
It is my first project build on python using python kivymd library.

You will need to create a virtual environment, before running the 'chatbot.py' file. 

By using the following commands in any terminal in Windows Machine (powershell is recommended):
    
    pip install virtualenv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1 
    (This command will create and activate the virtual environment named 'venv' in powershell.)
  
Now, some necessary modules are required to install in order to run the code safely, using the pip command in the same environment.
